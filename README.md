# Stereograms

This is a student project made for Computer Graphics Basis classes at AGH UST.


A purpose of the application is generating random dots stereograms based on gray-scale depth map. The program allows to save, simply print and copy the outcome to a clipboard. It is possible to choose if the stereogram should be white-black or colourful.
